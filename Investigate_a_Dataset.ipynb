    "### Dataset Description \n",
    "\n",
    "The Movie Database (TMDb) is a community-built movie and TV database, where every piece of data has been added by an amazing community dating back to 2008. It provides a large dataset of movies, including various details about each film.\n",
    "\n",
    "The TMDb movie data set includes the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **id**: A unique identifier for each movie.\n",
    "2. **imdb_id**: A unique identifier for each movie on IMDB.\n",
    "3. **popularity**: A numeric quantity specifying the movie's popularity.\n",
    "4. **budget**: The budget in which the movie was made.\n",
    "5. **revenue**: The worldwide revenue generated by the movie.\n",
    "6. **original_title**: The title of the movie before translation or adaptation.\n",
    "7. **cast**: The names of main performers in the movie.\n",
    "8. **homepage**: A link to the homepage of the movie.\n",
    "9. **director**: The director of the movie.\n",
    "10. **tagline**: Movie's tagline.\n",
    "11. **keywords**: Keywords or tags related to the movie.\n",
    "12. **overview**: A brief description of the movie.\n",
    "13. **runtime**: The running time of the movie in minutes.\n",
    "14. **genres**: The genre of the movie, Action, Comedy, Thriller, Romance, etc.\n",
    "15. **production_companies**: The production companies of the movie.\n",
    "16. **release_date**: The date on which the movie was released.\n",
    "17. **vote_count**: The count of votes received by the movie.\n",
    "18. **vote_average**: The average rating of the movie.\n",
    "19. **release_year**: The year of movie release.\n",
    "20. **budget_adj**: Budget of the movie with consideration for inflation over time.\n",
    "21. **revenue_adj**: Revenue of the movie with consideration for inflation over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset can be used to conduct various analyses, such as understanding movie trends over the years, genre popularity, the relation between budget and revenue, and other interesting facets of the film industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question(s) for Analysis\n",
    "1. **Which director has the highest average revenue per film?**\n",
    "    - This could help identify directors who consistently produce high-grossing films.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Is there a correlation between the number of films an actor has been in and the average revenue of these films?**\n",
    "    - This can provide insight into whether seasoned actors contribute to higher revenues.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What is the average revenue difference between movies that have a homepage and those that do not?**\n",
    "    - This can explore if having a dedicated homepage significantly affects a movie's success.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Are movies with a single genre or multiple genres more popular?**\n",
    "    - This could indicate whether audiences prefer pure genre films or genre blends.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **What is the trend of the 'Popularity' score over years?**\n",
    "    - This can help understand the validity of the 'Popularity' metric over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Which month has seen the maximum releases of high-grossing movies?**\n",
    "    - This can help identify 'golden months' for releasing a new movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Has the ratio of budget to revenue changed over time?**\n",
    "    - This could indicate changes in the cost-effectiveness of movie production.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Is there a keyword or set of keywords that are particularly prevalent in high revenue movies?**\n",
    "    - This can show if certain themes are more lucrative than others."

You should compute the relevant statistics throughout the analysis when an inference is made about the data.

Look at one variable at a time, and then follow it up by looking at relationships between variables. You should explore at least three variables in relation to the primary question. This can be an exploratory relationship between three variables of interest, or looking at how two independent variables relate to a single dependent variable of interest. Lastly, you  should perform both single-variable (1d) and multiple-variable (2d) explorations.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this analysis, we explored a dataset from The Movie Database (TMDb) containing information about movies. We conducted various analyses and answered several research questions based on the dataset. Here are the key findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The director with the highest average revenue per film is `Chris Buck|Jennifer Lee`.\n",
    "2. There is a `weak positive correlation` between the number of films an actor has been in and the average revenue of those films. However, other factors also influence movie revenue.\n",
    "3. Movies with a homepage have, on average, a higher revenue than movies without a homepage. Having a dedicated homepage may contribute to a movie's success.\n",
    "4. Movies with multiple genres are more popular than movies with a single genre. Audiences tend to prefer genre blends that encompass diverse thematic elements.\n",
    "5. The '`Popularity`' score of movies has generally increased over the years, indicating a positive trend. However, there are fluctuations and variations in popularity from year to year.\n",
    "6. `June` is the month that has seen the maximum releases of high-grossing movies. Releasing movies in `June` might increase the chances of achieving high revenues.\n",
    "7. The ratio of budget to revenue has changed over time, showing significant variation. The changes are not consistent, and there are spikes and drops in the ratio throughout different years.\n",
    "8. The keyword \"`dystopia`\" appears most frequently in high-revenue movies released during the most profitable month. Other prevalent keywords include \"`duringcreditsstinger`,\" \"`monster`,\" \"`sequel`,\" and \"`based` on novel.\" These keywords represent a variety of themes and genres associated with profitable releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings provide insights into the movie industry and can be valuable for filmmakers, production companies, and industry professionals. However, it's important to note that the analysis is based on the available dataset and has limitations. The conclusions should be interpreted in the context of the dataset and may not be universally applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further analysis, considering additional factors and datasets, could provide deeper insights into the film industry and its dynamics.\n"
